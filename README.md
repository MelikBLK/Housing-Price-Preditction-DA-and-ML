# 🏠 **Housing Price Prediction Lab**

---

## 📝 **Project Overview**
This python notebook focuses on predicting house prices for residential properties in Ames, Iowa. Using a dataset with 79 variables that describe various features of each home, we aim to predict the final sale price of houses in the test set. This lab emphasizes advanced data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and regression model training to achieve an accurate prediction.

## 🎯 **Objectives**
- 🔍 Perform advanced feature engineering on a real-world housing dataset.
- 🛠️ Train and compare multiple machine learning regression models to identify the best predictor for house prices.
- 📈 Predict house prices on the test dataset and evaluate the model's performance.

## 🗃️ **Dataset**
The dataset used in this lab is the **Ames Housing dataset**, which includes detailed information about residential homes in Ames, Iowa. It is split into training and test sets:

- **Training Dataset**: 1460 samples, including the target variable `SalePrice`.
- **Test Dataset**: 1459 samples, excluding `SalePrice`.

Key features include:
- `OverallQual`: Overall quality of the material and finish of the house.
- `GrLivArea`: Above-ground living area in square feet.
- `GarageCars`: Capacity of garage in car spaces.
- `TotalBsmtSF`: Total basement area in square feet.
- **...and many more.**

## 🔄 **Workflow**
### 1. Data Exploration
   - Loaded the dataset and displayed initial rows to understand the structure.
   - Identified and analyzed missing values and data types.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
   - **Handling Missing Values**: 
     - Applied median imputation for numerical columns with missing values.
     - Used mode imputation for categorical columns with missing data.
   - **Feature Engineering**:
     - Created new features and transformed existing ones to capture underlying patterns and relationships within the data.

### 3. Model Training
   - Trained multiple regression models to predict the sale price, including:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Ridge Regression**
     - **Lasso Regression**
   - Compared model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to determine the most accurate predictor.

### 4. Evaluation and Prediction
   - Evaluated the best-performing model, **Ridge Regression**, on the test dataset.
   - Generated predictions for house prices and interpreted model accuracy based on performance metrics.

## 📊 **Results**
- The best-performing model was **Ridge Regression**, achieving an RMSE of approximately _(add specific value)_ on the validation set.
- Predicted house prices for the test dataset were generated, with results summarized and interpreted.
